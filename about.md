Hey, welcome to my blog!  

I study embedded systems with a focus on security. Loving tech and cybersecurity I decided to blog about it. Hope you enjoy the blog as much as I do. If you have questions or comments feel free to reach out via twitter *@simon_cybersec* or email *coffeeandcoding@t-online.de*. Also check out my github where you can find some nice tools I've written.  

Just take a cup of coffee and enjoy reading ;)
