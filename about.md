Hey, I am an embedded systems engineer. Loving tech, linux, embedded systems and cybersecurity I decided to blog about it...if I find the time to XD  
If you have questions or comments feel free to reach out via twitter *@simon_cybersec* or email *coffeeandcoding@t-online.de*.

Take a cup of coffee and enjoy reading ;)
