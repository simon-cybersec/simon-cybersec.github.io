Hey, I am simon-cybersec!  

I study embedded systems with a focus on security. Loving tech and cybersecurity I decided to blog about it. It's a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy the blog as much as I do. If you have questions or comments feel free to reach out via twitter *@simon_cybersec* or email *coffeeandcoding@t-online.de*  

Just take a cup of coffee and enjoy reading ;)
