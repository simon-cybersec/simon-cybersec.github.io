## The three big goals of security
In cybersecurity three main goals are specified:

- Integrity  
- Availability

## Confidentiality
If something is classified as confidential no unauthorized person should be able to read your data. This is meant by the term *confidentiality*.

## Integrity
The goal of *integrity* means nobody is able to change your data. It could happen that someone is able to read your data. Then the goal of *confidentiality* is affected. But if the person is not able to change your data *integrity* is ensured.

## Availability
May it be a hardware failure, a software malfunction or a malicious cyber attack - there are times a customer can't reach your resource. This is called the **downtime**. *Availability* is the goal to minimize the downtime.
